#If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.
invites = ['messi', 'pele', 'cristiano']
print(f'{invites[0].title()}, you are invited to dinner!')
print(f'{invites[1].title()}, you are invited to dinner!')
print(f'{invites[2].title()}, you are invited to dinner!')
