#Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as “I would like to own a Honda motorcycle.”
list = ['car', 'boat', 'bike', 'train']
print(f'I would like to own a Honda {list[0]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a Honda {list[1]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a Honda {list[2]}.')
print(f'I would like to own a Honda {list[-1]}.')
